# photo-app

The project was put here only to practice how to deploy an react-app on GitHub Pages. Here is the [link](https://muzabol2.github.io/photo-app/) to that.

Regarding the app itself - you can upload photos and give them names. That's all it does. But of course, because there is no backend to it (firebase etc.), after reloding the page, the content will vanish...
