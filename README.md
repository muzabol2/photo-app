## General info
Project displays:
* Images that a user uploaded
* Names of photos that a user gives himself
* Reloading the page erases the content

## Deployment
Thanks to Github Pages, I was able to easily deploy the application. You can see and test it yourself!

## Screenshots
When uploaded some photos it will look like this:

It is adapted to display on smaller screens, such as tablets:

After clicking on button "Upload Picture" and choosing a photo from your files, you will need to enter the title for it:

## Technologies
Main:
* React

Libraries:

* gh-pages

## Setup
Copy repository on your machine. To download all needed dependencies (see package.json to know what they are) type in command line in the repo's location:
```bash
npm install
```
To run application on your local machine type: 
```bash
npm run start
```

## Status
Project is not perfect but for me it is finished. I do not exclude the possibility of further developments, e.g. adding firebase backend, uploading file by drag and drop, refine the CSS, etc.
